## 🎯 The Pitch

**MS CS @ NYU + Stern FinTech** • Ranked #1/2,800 in programming • **McKinsey Forward Alum**

I taught self-driving cars to see at 80% autonomy. Now I teach algorithms to see money.

Went from scoring 98.1% accuracy grading 8K papers with BERT → building VaR dashboards that cut risk insights by 40% → optimizing sub-2s latency trading systems. My Monte Carlo simulations run 10,000+ scenarios before your coffee gets cold.

**Current Arsenal:**
- Event-driven trading strategies with CVaR and Sortino ratios
- Real-time risk monitoring systems (10K+ concurrent users, 95% uptime)
- Production ML: GLIDE models at 96% precision, pix2pix GANs at 90% accuracy
- Financial forecasting models improving $10M+ datasets by 12% (McKinsey/AWS)

## 🤝 Let's Build

I don't do leetcode. I do systems where Python meets P&L, algorithms have attitude, and the only thing moving faster than the code is the money it manages.

**Seeking:** Teams where technical debt excites me more than it scares me.

*From SD-WANs to cGANs, from autonomous vehicles to autonomous trading—if it computes, I've probably optimized it.*
